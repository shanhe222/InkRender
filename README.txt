# Project Name
Ink rendering system

## Overview
This project is a Visual Studio solution (`.sln`) designed to load 3D models and render them into 2D images. The system includes features for adjusting rendering parameters and offers a user-friendly interface for ease of use.

## Functional Requirements

1. **3D Model Loading and Rendering**  
   The system should have the capability to load 3D models and render them into 2D images. Users should be able to import external 3D models into the system, which will automatically process these models and generate high-quality 2D rendered images, preserving the key features and artistic style of the models.

2. **Parameter Editing and Adjustment**  
   The system should allow users to edit and adjust rendering parameters, particularly the thickness and intensity of edge outlines. Users can control the visual effects of the edges by using a simple interface with sliders or inputting values, catering to different artistic styles or personal preferences.

3. **Texture Mapping Correction**  
   The system should provide an option to enable or disable texture mapping for correcting the display of edge outlines. This feature allows users to choose whether to use texture mapping in the rendering process, giving them more flexibility in controlling the final appearance of the image.

4. **Curvature Correction**  
   The system should support enabling or disabling curvature correction to adjust the shading intensity in the rendered image. Users can choose whether to apply curvature correction based on their needs, allowing for more refined lighting effects or maintaining a simpler style in the image.

5. **Light Source Position and Intensity Adjustment**  
   The system should allow users to adjust the position and intensity of the light source to influence the illumination of the 3D model. Users can adjust these parameters in real-time to observe how changes in lighting affect the image, enabling them to achieve their desired artistic effects.

6. **Real-Time Frame Rate Display**  
   The system should display the real-time frame rate on the interface, allowing users to understand the current rendering performance. This helps users balance visual effects and system performance when adjusting parameters.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Ease of Learning and Understanding**  
   The system should be designed to be easy to learn and understand, allowing even users without a professional background to quickly grasp the basic functions. The system should provide clear guidance and help documentation to support the learning process.

2. **User-Friendly Parameter Adjustment Interface**  
   The system should provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily adjust rendering parameters. The interface design should be simple and intuitive, ensuring that users can easily find the functions and options they need and immediately see the effects of their adjustments.

3. **Intuitive Design and Navigation**  
   The overall design of the system should be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring that users can quickly understand the system architecture and navigation logic. The layout of the interface should be clear and logical, enabling users to efficiently complete operations and enhance the overall user experience.
