InkRender Developer Documentation
Introduction
InkRender is a real-time 3D model rendering system designed for creating ink-style artwork. The system is developed using C++ and OpenGL, with Visual Studio as the integrated development environment (IDE). This document provides an overview of the system's architecture, setup instructions for the local development environment, and deployment guidelines.

Platform Architecture
Architecture Overview
InkRender operates as a standalone application that leverages the power of OpenGL for real-time rendering. The application is structured to efficiently load, process, and display 3D models with a focus on delivering high-quality ink-style visual effects.

Components
Rendering Engine: The core of InkRender, built using OpenGL, handles the real-time rendering of 3D models.
Model Loader: This component loads 3D models into the system, supporting various file formats.
Shader System: Custom shaders are used to achieve the ink-style effects, providing flexibility in visual appearance.
User Interface: A minimal user interface built within the application allows users to interact with the 3D models, adjust settings, and view the rendering output.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: C++
Graphics API: OpenGL
Development Environment: Visual Studio
3D Model Formats: OBJ, FBX (with the potential to support others)
Programming Style
Code Conventions: Follows modern C++ standards (C++11 and later).
Design Patterns: Utilizes common design patterns such as Singleton for the renderer, Factory for model loaders, and Observer for UI updates.
Error Handling: Primarily uses exception handling in C++ to manage errors, with comprehensive logging for debugging purposes.
Setting Up the Project in a Local Development Environment

System Requirements for Deployment
Operating System: Windows 10 or higher
Processor: Intel Core i7 (10th generation) or equivalent
Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 2060 or higher
RAM: 16 GB or more
Storage: 10 GB of available disk space
Additional Software: OpenGL-compatible graphics drivers, and Visual C++ Redistributable packages.
Development Tools: Visual Studio 2019 or higher with C++ development workload

Steps for Deployment
Prepare the release build:

In Visual Studio, switch to the Release configuration.
Build the project to generate the optimized executable.
Package the application:

Ensure all required runtime libraries (e.g., DLLs for OpenGL) are included in the package.
Create an installer using a tool like Inno Setup or NSIS, or simply zip the executable with all dependencies.
Deploy to target machine:

Copy the installer or the zipped package to the target machine.
Install or extract the application on the target machine.
Run the application to verify successful deployment.
Post-deployment checks:

Ensure that the application runs smoothly on the target hardware.
Check that all features are functional, and performance is within acceptable limits.
